st.write("""
         Spotify describes valence as a measure of the musical positivity conveyed by a track. It is represented 
         as a numerical value between 0.0 and 1.0, with higher values indicating a more positive or happy mood, 
         and lower values indicating a more negative or sad mood. \n Spotify calculates valence scores based on a 
         combination of musical features, such as tempo, rhythm, and harmony, as well as lyrics and other contextual 
         information. Valence scores are used by Spotify's recommendation algorithms to suggest songs that match a 
         user's mood or preferences.

st.write("""
         Spotify describes danceability as a measure of how suitable a track is for dancing based on its tempo, rhythm 
         stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. It is represented as a numerical value between 0.0 and 1.0, 
         with higher values indicating that a track is more danceable. \n Danceability is calculated by analyzing various 
         musical features, such as the track's BPM (beats per minute), the regularity of the rhythm, and the presence of a 
         strong and consistent beat. Other factors, such as the track's time signature and the presence of vocals, can also 
         affect the danceability score. \n Spotify uses danceability scores as part of its recommendation system to suggest 
         songs that are suitable for dancing or to create playlists tailored to users' workout routines or dance parties.
