        Spotify describes valence as a measure of the musical positivity conveyed by a track. It is represented 
        as a numerical value between 0.0 and 1.0, with higher values indicating a more positive or happy mood, 
        and lower values indicating a more negative or sad mood. \n Spotify calculates valence scores based on a 
        combination of musical features, such as tempo, rhythm, and harmony, as well as lyrics and other contextual 
        information. Valence scores are used by Spotify's recommendation algorithms to suggest songs that match a 
        user's mood or preferences.

        Spotify describes danceability as a measure of how suitable a track is for dancing based on its tempo, rhythm 
        stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. It is represented as a numerical value between 0.0 and 1.0, 
        with higher values indicating that a track is more danceable. \n Danceability is calculated by analyzing various 
        musical features, such as the track's BPM (beats per minute), the regularity of the rhythm, and the presence of a 
        strong and consistent beat. Other factors, such as the track's time signature and the presence of vocals, can also 
        affect the danceability score. \n Spotify uses danceability scores as part of its recommendation system to suggest 
        songs that are suitable for dancing or to create playlists tailored to users' workout routines or dance parties.

                the relationship between the valence score and danceability of songs across the top 10 most 
                common genres in the dataset. The y-axis shows the danceability rating, while the x-axis 
                shows the valence score. Each circle represents a song, and its color indicates the valence 
                score of the song. The tooltip shows additional information about each song, such as 
                its name, artist, genre, valence score, and danceability rating. By examining the scatter 
                plot, we can see how the valence score and danceability of songs tend to vary across 
                different genres. Some genres, such as pop and rock, have a wider range of valence scores 
                and danceability ratings, while others, such as hip-hop and R&B, tend to have higher 
                danceability ratings but lower valence scores

                data from a merged dataset of streaming information on various songs and artists. Each 
                circle represents a song, and the position of the circle along the x-axis indicates the 
                valence score of the song. The y-axis shows the artist genre. Hover over a circle to see 
                the song name, artist name, artist genre, valence score, and danceability score. The color 
                of the circles indicates the valence score of the song, with warmer colors representing 
                higher scores. The chart helps to visualize the distribution of valence scores across 
                different genres of music.
